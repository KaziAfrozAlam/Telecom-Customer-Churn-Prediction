# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. By analyzing customer demographics, service usage, and billing details, the model helps identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

## Key Objectives
- Understand customer churn behavior
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build and evaluate ML classification models
- Identify the most important factors contributing to churn

---

## Dataset
- **Name:** Telco Customer Churn (Public Dataset)
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes / No)
- **Features:** Demographics, contract details, subscribed services, billing information

---

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

Models were evaluated using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**, and **Confusion Matrix**.

---

## Key Insights
- Customers with **short tenure**, **month-to-month contracts**, and **higher monthly charges** are more likely to churn
- Tree-based models performed better than baseline models

---

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
